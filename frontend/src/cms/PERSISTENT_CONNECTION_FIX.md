# Persistent Connection Fix for SPA Navigation

## Problem
When navigating between pages in the SPA, the real-time connection would:
1. **Go offline** when components unmounted
2. **Reconnect** when new components mounted  
3. **Cause instability** with frequent connect/disconnect cycles
4. **Disrupt real-time updates** during navigation

## Root Cause
Multiple components (Orders.jsx, Topbar.jsx) were subscribing directly to `realtimeService`, causing:
- Multiple SSE connections
- Connection drops on component unmount
- Reconnection loops during page navigation
- Race conditions between components

## Solution: Global Real-time Manager

### 1. Created `globalRealtimeManager.js`
- **Singleton pattern** - One instance manages all real-time connections
- **Persistent connection** - Survives page navigation
- **Event forwarding** - Routes events to multiple subscribers
- **Connection pooling** - Prevents multiple SSE connections

### 2. Updated Components
- **Orders.jsx** - Now uses global manager instead of direct service
- **Topbar.jsx** - Also uses global manager for consistency
- **Automatic cleanup** - Proper subscription management

### 3. Enhanced Connection Stability
- **Exponential backoff** with max delay cap (30 seconds)
- **Better error handling** for connection drops
- **Persistent connection state** across navigation

## How It Works

```javascript
// Before: Direct subscription (causes connection drops)
const unsubscribe = realtimeService.subscribe('order.created', callback);

// After: Global manager (persistent connection)
const unsubscribe = globalRealtimeManager.subscribe('order.created', callback);
```

### Connection Flow
1. **Global manager initializes** once when app loads
2. **Establishes single SSE connection** to backend
3. **Components subscribe** to global manager (not direct service)
4. **Events forwarded** to all subscribers
5. **Navigation preserves** connection state

## Benefits

### ✅ **Stable Connection**
- No more offline/online cycling during navigation
- Single persistent SSE connection
- Survives page changes and component remounts

### ✅ **Better Performance**  
- Reduced connection overhead
- No duplicate SSE connections
- Efficient event distribution

### ✅ **Improved UX**
- Consistent real-time updates
- No connection status flickering
- Smooth navigation experience

### ✅ **Debugging Friendly**
- Centralized connection management
- Clear subscription tracking
- Better error handling and logging

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
Page Load → Connect → Navigate → Disconnect → Reconnect → Navigate → Disconnect...
```

### After Fix  
```
Page Load → Connect → Navigate → Stay Connected → Navigate → Stay Connected...
```

## Debug Features

Access global manager in browser console:
```javascript
// Check connection status
window.globalRealtimeManager.getConnectionStatus()

// View subscriber stats  
window.globalRealtimeManager.getStats()

// Force reconnection (for testing)
window.globalRealtimeManager.forceReconnect()
```

## Files Modified

1. **`globalRealtimeManager.js`** (New) - Centralized real-time management
2. **`Orders.jsx`** - Updated to use global manager
3. **`Topbar.jsx`** - Updated to use global manager  
4. **`realtimeService.js`** - Enhanced connection stability

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ **No connection drops** during page navigation
- ✅ **Stable "Live" status** indicator
- ✅ **Consistent real-time updates** across all pages
- ✅ **Single SSE connection** maintained throughout app session
- ✅ **Smooth navigation** without real-time interruption

The real-time system now maintains a persistent connection that survives SPA navigation, providing a stable and reliable real-time experience!
